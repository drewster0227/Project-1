From the home vs away analysis section we can see there is a significant advantage to being the home team. The two paired t-test showed a incredibly low p-value meaning there is a statistically significant higher amount of points earned as the home team compared to the away team. 

In the previous position section of the analysis we see that there is a direct correlation between how a team finishes in the prior seasons and how many points they give up in the following season. The linear regression shows a p-value lower than any reasonable alpha confirming this predicitor. 

Finally the win-streak section yielded little helpful predictors. In the anova test we see a p-value of 0.623 meaning there is no significant increase in win percentages after a 2-game or 3-game win streaks.
